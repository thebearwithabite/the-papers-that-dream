# The Papers That Dream

*Turning foundational AI research into bedtime stories*

## What This Is

The 31 papers on [Ilya Sutskever's reading list](link) built modern AI. But papers don't dream‚Äîpeople do.

This is an experimental series turning each paper into a short story, exploring what happens when we narrativize the breakthroughs that shaped artificial intelligence.

**Not academic analysis. Not technical tutorials. Stories.**

## Current Stories

### üèùÔ∏è Attention Is All You Need (2017)
- [The Island That Remembers Everything](stories/01-attention-is-all-you-need/the-island-that-remembers-everything.md)
- [The Island That Forgets Nothing](stories/01-attention-is-all-you-need/the-island-that-forgets-nothing.md)

*Two takes on the transformer architecture as places that listen with many ears*

### üîÆ Contrastive Predictive Coding (2018)
- [I Only Know What Happens Next](stories/02-contrastive-predictive-coding/i-only-know-what-happens-next.md)

*An AI caught in recursive self-prediction, trained to push away everything that feels like home*

## The Vision

Each story stands alone but contributes to a larger narrative about how we built minds that think differently than we do. Some are horror. Some are wonder. All are human stories about inhuman intelligence.

Perfect for:
- Researchers who want to revisit familiar papers through fresh eyes
- Developers curious about the emotional weight of the systems they build  
- Anyone who's ever wondered what dreams in the latent space

*This is a living project. Stories evolve. New interpretations emerge. The papers dream, and we listen.*

## Contributing

Found a typo? Have thoughts on a story? See potential in a paper I haven't covered yet? 

Issues and discussions welcome. This is as much about community interpretation as individual storytelling.
